# AuroraHell - Changelog
**Current Version:** 2.1.0
**Last Update:** 15/07/2025

This is the changelog of the Discord bot AuroraHell.

## Date 20/09/2025 - Version 2.1.1 changes:

- Removed the entire database/history player tracking system because it was disrupting the gameâ€™s server. Since it required too many requests, it was affecting network traffic and causing issues with loading website pages and in-game connections.

## Date 15/07/2025 - Version 2.1.0 changes:

- Changed the icon and banner of the Discord bot
- Added the progress tracking player system (This system can track who changed guilds and who changed names, but I haven't implemented any use for that)
- Added commands for checking experience and skill progress over the past 2/7/30/90/180 days (2 and 7 days are not included for skill progress)
- Added proper formulas for level, skill and lost experience per death (Skill formula is not 100% correct, contact me if you have a more precise formula)
- "stat-calculator-ptraining" command level limited was changed to 1000 (instead of 999)
